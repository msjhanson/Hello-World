# Hello-World

Hello everyone, 
  My name is Jennifer and I am slowly teaching myself code. I already have a basic knowledge of html and css. I am looking to better my understanding and eventually dream to be a front end web developer. I also hope to continue my learning and learn the Unity engine as well and make video games on the side.
